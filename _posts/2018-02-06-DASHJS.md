The ABR Rules Collection (see ABRRulesCollection.js) has a list of rules which are queried before every new segment download. Each rule returns a maximum index, and the final decision is the minimum of each rule's return.

## Primary Rules

The main rule driving ABR is either ThroughputRule or BolaRule. A player instance can be set to choose either of the two rules using the [MediaPlayer.enableBufferOccupancyABR(value)](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc/module-MediaPlayer.html#enableBufferOccupancyABR) method before loading the stream, where value=true enables BolaRule (disabling ThroughputRule) and value=false disables BolaRule (enabing ThroughputRule). If MediaPlayer.enableBufferOccupancyABR() is not called, ThroughputRule is enabled and BolaRule is disabled.

**ThroughputRule** uses the recent throughput history to predict the future throughput. Once it has a throughput estimate (see ThroughputHistory.js), ThroughputRule scales it down by a 90% safety factor and chooses the highest bitrate supported by the safe throughput. If ThroughputRule chooses the top bitrate and the buffer level rises above some rich buffer threshold (see [MediaPlayer.setRichBufferThreshold(value)](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc/module-MediaPlayer.html#setRichBufferThreshold)) then it will not choose a lower bitrate until the buffer level drops below the rich buffer threshold, even if the throughput drops.

**BolaRule** uses the buffer level to determine the bitrate: it prefers lower bitrates when the buffer level is lower and higher bitrates when the buffer level is higher. To avoid oscillations, BolaRule does not switch up to a bitrate if the throughput estimate (see ThroughputHistory.js) does not support the new higher bitrate. BolaRule keeps track of why the buffer level drops, maintaining a higher bitrate when the buffer level drops for reasons unrelated to network bandwidth limitations, e.g., when the buffer level is limited because of segment availability in live streaming.

**Coming Soon:** The PR [#2083](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/pull/2083) obsoletes the MediaPlayer.enableBufferOccupancyABR() method and instead switches dynamically between the two rules, getting the best of both. It also obsoletes MediaPlayer.setRichBufferThreshold() because BolaRule is selected for high-buffer cases. See [BOLA Status](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/BOLA-status) for more details.

## Secondary Rules

While the active primary rule is the main determining factor, there is a number of secondary rules which handle some special cases.

**InsufficientBufferRule** is a safety net to avoid rebuffering. When the buffer level is low, InsufficientBufferRule limits the bitrate to a conservative throughput estimate. If rebuffering does occur, InsufficientBufferRule forces the lowest bitrate to speed up recovery.

**SwitchHistoryRule** avoids rapid bitrate oscillations. If any of the other ABR rules switch down from some bitrate, then SwitchHistoryRule disallows that bitrate and any higher bitrate for eight segments.

**DroppedFramesRule** avoids bitrates that cannot render properly due to CPU limitations. When the video element drops more than 15% of the frames for some bitrate, DroppedFramesRule disallows that bitrate and any higher bitrate.

## Progress Monitoring Rule

The above rules are used before a new segment download starts. If the bandwidth drops excessively during the course of a high-bitrate download, it increases the risk of rebuffering.

**AbandonRequestRule** monitors the download progress during a segment download. If there is a rebuffering risk, it abandons the download and switches to a lower, safer bitrate.
